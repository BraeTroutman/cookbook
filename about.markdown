My name is Brae, I'm a software engineer and cooking hobbyist--

Cooking is a love language, and sharing food and recipes is a way that I connect with and care for the people I love

Let me know if you enjoy or have reccommendations for these recipes, or if you have any other ones of mine you've tried that I should add!

## About this website

This website is an exercise in automation-- the source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/BraeTroutman/cookbook) 
and built using Jekyll and Github pages. Recipes are written in [Cooklang](https://cooklang.org/) and then automatically
converted to HTML using a [Jekyll cooklang converter package](https://github.com/BraeTroutman/jekyll-cooklang-converter)
(also implemented and maintained by yours truly)

If you like this website as a way to track and share recipes, please fork the source and try it yourself! Moreover, if you feel like
it could be better implemented or improved upon, feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.
