## Ingredients
- *1 box* strawberry cake mix
- *1 cup* heavy whipping cream
- *2/3 cup* sugar
- *2 blocks* softened cream cheese
- strawberry ice cream topping
- *1 package* strawberries
- *1 cup* heavy whipping cream
- *2 tablespoons* powdered sugar
- *3 drops* red gel food coloring

## Cookware
- springform pan
- whisk or (if you value your wrists) mixer
- piping bag

## Steps
1. mix strawberry cake mix according to package instructions

2. bake the cake mix according to package instructions in a springform pan

3. while the cake is cooling, we can mix the cheesecake layer

4. whip using a whisk or (if you value your wrists) mixer heavy whipping cream
until stiff peaks

5. set the whipped cream aside

6. whip sugar and softened cream cheese until smooth and well incorporated

7. gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture

8. pop off the springform rim from the pan, and cut the rounded top off the cake

9. place the rim back on the pan, and spread strawberry ice cream topping over
the top of the cake

10. line the edge of the pan on top of the cake with slices of strawberries, and
layer strawberry slices over the topping as well

11. spread the cheesecake filling over everything, filling in between and
against the strawberry slices to help hold them in place

12. let everything sit in the fridge for at least 3 hours to allow the filling
to set

13. once set, if you want more cake in the end result, you can place the rounded
cake top back on top of the set filling

14. whip heavy whipping cream with powdered sugar and red gel food coloring. The
powdered sugar stabilizes the whipped cream, preventing it from melting after a
few hours

15. use a piping bag to top the cake with the stabilized whipped cream topping
in whatever pattern you like
