## Steps
1. heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat

2. once hot, add minced garlic and minced ginger to the skillet, and fry until
fragrant (about (aromatics)1 minutes)

3. add shrimp (peeled, thawed) to the skillet and spread around evenly. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper

4. after cooking about 2 minutes on one side, flip the shrimp to cook on the
other side. Generally speaking, just fry until all the shrimp have lost their
raw grey color, and have a pleasant pink tinge throughout

5. to make the peanut dressing, mix creamy peanut butter, rice vinegar, soy
sauce, the juice of a fresh lime{1}, honey, sesame oil, sriracha, ground ginger,
garlic powder and mix until consistent

6. if the sauce is a bit too thick, you can water it down by mixing in a
tablespoon of water at a time

7. cook vermicelli rice noodles according to package instructions. Once they are
cooked, drain and rinse with cold water to stop cooking and bring to a cooler
temp for the salad

8. top the noodles with chopped romain lettuce, shredded carrots, diced long
english cucumber, green onion, cilantro, and the cooked shrimp from earlier. You
can optionally garnish with sesame seeds

9. add the peanut dressing to each salad, mix, and enjoy!
