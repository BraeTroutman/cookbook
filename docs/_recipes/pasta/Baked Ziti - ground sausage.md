## Steps
1. set a pot of water on the stove, to boil (you'll need for pasta later), and
preheat the oven to 350

2. cut mushrooms into slices, and sautee (no oil) in a pan over medium high heat
until browned. Set aside

3. brown ground sausage in the same pan, seasoning with garlic powder, italian
seasoning, and chili powder set aside

4. the water should hopefully be boiling by now

5. chop and sautee large yellow onion in olive oil. Seasoning with salt. Add the
bell pepper, chopped

6. add back in the mushrooms and sausage, and pour pasta sauce over everything.
Mix well, and allow it to simmer until it bubbles a bit at the bottom

7. mix together ricotta and shredded mozarella

8. layer half of the cooked pasta into the bottom of a greased casserole dish.
Ladle half of the meat + veggie mixture on top. Then, spread the cheese mixture
from the previous step on top of everything. Layer sliced provolone on that,
followed by the rest of the sauce, the rest of the pasta, and a final layer of
mozarella cheese. Sprinkle the top with italian seasoning

9. put the dish in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then it's all ready!
