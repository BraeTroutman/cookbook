- *3 tablespoon* greek yoghurt

- *1/8 teaspoon* baking soda
- *1/2 cup* besan (gram) flower
- *3 tablespoon* cornstarch
- *1 and 1/2 cup* greek yoghurt
- *1/4 cup* chopped cilantro
- *1/2 teaspoon* cumin
- *1/2 teaspoon* garam masala
- *1/2@teaspoon* salt
- *1/4 cup* english cucumber (grated)

## Cookware
- air fryer
- large mixing bowl
- baking sheet

## Steps
1. preheat air fryer to 360

2. chop chicken breast or thighs into bite size pieces, and place in a large
mixing bowl.

3. Chop green onions and cilantro, mince garlic, grate ginger, and pour it all
over the chicken

4. pour lemon juice and greek yoghurt over the chicken

5. mix all the dry spices in a separate bowl: chili powder, turmeric, garam
masala, salt, pepper, baking soda, besan (gram) flower, cornstarch

6. add the spices over the chicken and wet ingredients and mix well until all of
the nuggets are thoroughly coated in the mixture

7. Put them in the air fryer in small batches, ensuring that all the pieces have
spaces between for air to flow. Spray with cooking oil, and cook for 6 minutes
at 360, shake them around, and then cook for another 6 minutes at 360. To keep
the finished pakoras warm while the rest cook, place them on a baking sheet in
the oven with the heat set to lowest

8. I like to serve the pakoras with Raita, a kind of yoghurt based dressing:
mix greek yoghurt with chopped cilantro, cumin, garam masala, salt, and english
cucumber (grated). another great dipping option is green chutney, which I buy at
Golden India because I don't have a food processor
