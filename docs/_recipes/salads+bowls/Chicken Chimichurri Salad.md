3. while the chicken is cooking, dice red onion and red bell pepper

4. add peppers and onions to a large mixing bowl

5. add olive oil to the vegetables, in addition to salt, chili powder, and
pepper. Mix well

6. spread the vegetable mixture on a large baking sheet and bake for (veggies)15
minutes or until lightly charred around the edges

7. once everything is done cooking, add it all to the large mixing bowl again

if you let it sit, chill, and marinate in the fridge for an hour or so first
